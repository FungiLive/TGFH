[02:23 AM]: Your next step might be functional annotation, suggested commands:
-------------------------------------------------------
Run InterProScan (Docker required): 
funannotate iprscan -i ../out/S.eubayanus_FM1318 -m docker -c 28

Run antiSMASH: 
funannotate remote -i ../out/S.eubayanus_FM1318 -m antismash -e youremail@server.edu

Annotate Genome: 
funannotate annotate -i ../out/S.eubayanus_FM1318 --cpus 28 --sbt yourSBTfile.txt
